# Design-of-Ramjet-Rocket-Engine

 
It is required to design the ramjet rocket shown in the schematic. The engine intake comprises double-angle wedges to maximize total pressure recovery. The flow then is diffused to a lower Mach number to facilitate the heat addition process. The heat is added
in the combustion chamber and then the flow rushes out of the supersonic nozzle producing thrust by expanding it to the atmospheric pressure.

The design point flight conditions are: P=12.11kPa, T= 216.5K, and Mach is 2.75. The engine has a square cross-section with a side length of 25 cm. The maximum combustor temperature is 2200K. The design process generally exhibits an iterative scheme for the supersonic intake, the diffuser, the combustion chamber, and the supersonic nozzle.

The main objective is to maximize the produced thrust. This objective is achieved by acquiring maximum pressure recovery in the intake, increasing heat addition capacity through the combustion chamber, and optimizing the nozzle exit to throat area ratio. The intake design requires multivariable optimization of the intake parameters (θ1 and θ2) to obtain maximum total pressure recovery after two obliques and terminal normal shock waves.

A two-dimensional flow model will be implemented to model the intake wedges and one-dimensional flow for the terminal normal shock wave. The combustion chamber section will be modeled as a one-dimensional flow with heat addition assuming that total pressure at the exit of the combustor is reduced by 5% due to friction added to pressure drop due to heat. The diffuser and the supersonic nozzle will be modeled as a quasi-one-dimensional flow.
